//! # slowchop_console
//! A Quake style console and log plugin for Bevy.
//!
//! ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
//!
//! This was rushed out for the Bevy Jam, and only tested on macOS. Not recommended to use, unless
//! you're willing to help fix it up. üòÖ
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Uses bevy_ui for rendering.
//! - A console that can be opened and closed with a keypress.
//! - Captures all bevy (tracing) log messages and displays them in the console.
//! - Colorizes log messages depending on log level.
//! - Uses an enum as the possible actions. ("Commands" IMO is a better term but that's taken by Bevy.)
//!   - Enum supports floats, integers, strings, bools, and Vec of those types.
//!   - `Optional` arguments work, which must be after any non-optional arguments.
//!   - Actions are validated against the enum.
//! - Actions executed are emitted as an event.
//!
//! ## Actions Enum
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use bevy::prelude::Event;
//! use slowchop_console::Actions;
//!
//! #[derive(Actions, Event)]
//! enum MyGameActions {
//!    Quit,
//!    Spawn(f32, f32, f32, Option<String>),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This will create a `quit` action that takes no arguments. The `spawn` action takes 3 floats, and
//! optionally a String.
//!
//! Check out the [full example](examples/full.rs) on how to integrate.
